  // than `content` properties.
  // `scalafx.scene.Scene` creates by default its root element as `Group`. If we assign using `content`, children
  // are added to that group. That may have undesired layout complications. In our case it will prevent automatic
  // resizing of the content.
  // To work around this, we assign to `root` directly. Since `root` is an instance of JavaFX Pane,
  // we explicitly assign the (JavaFX) `delegate` of root pane that we want to use.
